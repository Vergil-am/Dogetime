# Description

This project started as a learning project for a movie app
implementing [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/). But then i decided to make it a real app to browse
and watch movies, series and anime.
The app utilizes TMDB API and web-scraping from various websites to ensure access to the newest and
highest quality media.

# Features

- Movie, TV and anime info.
- Watch the latest movies and TV/anime episodes.
- Browse your favorite media.
- watchlist.
- Episode tracking.
- Dark and light theme support
- app video player.
- anime in external player.

# What's missing

- online account.
- Multi language support.
- Movie and series subtitles (i need to find a way to load them in custom exoplayer controls).
- Timestamp tracking (the ability to continue where you left off)
